   Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable Form must also be made available in Source Code Form and that Source Code Form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code Form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available.

2. **Modifications:**
   
   The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3. **Required Notices:**
   
   You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, or other notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor other than You. You must retain, in the Source Code Form of any Covered Software that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Code and (ii) to the extent You distribute any Derivative Works, You must make a reasonable effort to indicate the Source Code form of the Original Code (such as the name of the source repository or original distribution archive).

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
